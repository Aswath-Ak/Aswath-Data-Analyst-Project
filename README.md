# 🌍 Climate Change Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **analyzing climate change patterns** using historical data to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in environmental indicators.  
The analysis was performed using **Microsoft Power BI** with data sourced from `Data (1).xlsx`.

The goal is to:
- Understand the impact of climate change over time
- Identify major changes in temperature, CO₂ emissions, and other environmental factors
- Create interactive dashboards for visual storytelling
